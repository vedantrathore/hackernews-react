## Hackernews in React!

A clone of [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) front page in [React](facebook.github.io/react) framework.

It uses [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as starter code and complies to ES6 standards of JavaScript (almost).

This was inspired from [react-hn](https://github.com/mking/react-hn) but since it was outdated, I had to rewrite the entire code.

Feel free to checkout the code, suggest some imporvements/feature or star it

### Installation
First install [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) then proceed with the following instructions

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vedantrathore/hackernews-react
$ cd hackernews-react
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
